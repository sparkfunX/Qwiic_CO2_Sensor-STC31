The STC3x sensor family is Sensirion’s series of Gas Concentration sensors designed for high-volume applications.
The STC3x utilizes a revolutionized thermal conductivity measurement principle, which results in superior repeatability and long-term stability.
This makes the STC31 a perfect choice for applications where reliability is key.
The outstanding performance of these sensors is based on Sensirion’s patented CMOSens® sensor technology, which combines the sensor element,
signal processing and digital calibration on a small CMOS chip.
The well-proven CMOS technology is perfectly suited for high-quality mass production and is the ideal choice for demanding and cost-sensitive OEM applications.

Our breakout is also equipped with a SHTC3 for accurate humidity and temperature compensation.
